# Welcome to Dozy!

My first attempt at a 2D game engine.  I am going in mostly dry, not reading any game design books, and watching various YouTube videos.  I wanted to see what I can muster without much guidance.


## Currently Working:
### Tilemap Editor
- Selecting from variety of tilesheets
- 3 paint layers, with optional rendering of each layer
- ability to zoom in and out on each window

# D2 - A 2D Game Engine
Welcome to D2, 2D game engine built in C, using minimal libraries, namely SDL/OpenGL.

## Motivation
This is mostly an exercise in learning.   I want to explore game engine development, graphics programming, memory management.  And I can't help but give myself seemingly impossible tasks

## Goals
If I can see it through, I'd like to have a very basic 2d game engine with shader support.  Enough of an engine to make some clones of some retro style games.

## Design Outline
Still an ever changing process.  But currently envisioning something like:

### Engine

 - [ ] Common C utils
 - [ ] Math
 - [ ] Renderer
	 - [ ] SDL / OpenGL hybrid
- [ ] Asset Manager
	- [ ] Sprites / Tilesheets
	- [ ] Shaders / Textures
- [ ] Arena Memory Allocator
- [ ] Entity/Component management
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Packaging / Parsing asset files

### Tools
- [ ] Tilemap Editor / Scene composer
- [ ] Entity / Component Editor
- [ ] Shader configuration
